                <h2>FOOD BANK DESIGN PROJECT</h2>
                <p class="subtitle"> REIMAGINING THE FOOD BANK AS A SPACE FOR SHARING, GATHERING, AND GROWING.</p>
                <p>This project transforms the traditional concept of a food bank into a space for sharing food, 
                    fostering community through a community garden, shared eating spaces, and an open marketplace.</p>
                <p>The design process began with the creation of sketch models to explore and refine a continuous 
                    form that fosters seamless transitions between spaces. The overarching goal was to create an 
                    inviting and inclusive environment where people could come together, exchange food, and build 
                    community connections. This vision informed the conceptual framework of the structure as a 
                    transitional space that merges function and flow.</p>

        <p>The chosen site is a park frequently used as a pedestrian thoroughfare, making it an ideal location 
            for this communal food bank The building’s placement and orientation were carefully considered to 
            complement the site’s natural pathways and enhance its role as a community hub.</p>

        <p>The structure is a continuous steel form, creating a cohesive experience that bridges the urban and 
            natural aspects of the site. The food bank incorporates a cascading garden, a marketplace, and 
            shared spaces for communal dining. The open design encourages interaction and inclusivity, while 
            the integration of green spaces promotes sustainability and community involvement.</p>
